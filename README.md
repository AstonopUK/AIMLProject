# AIMLProject<br/>
Project parts 1 and 2 for AI&amp;ML<br/>
<br/>
TODO;<br/>
__Algorithms__<br/>
-COMMENT CODE!!!<br/>
-Implement both breadth-first and A* search algorithms for navigating open planned terrain<br/>
-Configure user-made maps for actors to traverse<br/>
-Include pattern prevention; actors stop when no possible path visible<br/>
-Track visited nodes on tilemap<br/>
-Implement queue order for rapid movement decision, complete decision process prior to movement<br/>
__GAMIFY__<br/>
-Transfer algorithms into game solution (Easter egg hunt)<br/>
-Add AI logic - fuzzy logic & routine patterns?<br/>
-Create objectives - player has to collect more 'eggs' than AI; AI will randomly search for 'eggs'<br/>
-Win condition; when all 'eggs' collected, AI stops and score screen. Round based?<br/>
