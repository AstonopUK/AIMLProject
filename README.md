>Implement both breadth-first and A* search algorithms for navigating open planned terrain
>Configure user-made maps for actors to traverse
>Include pattern prevention; actors stop when no possible path visible
>Track visited nodes on tilemap
>>GAMIFY
>Transfer algorithms into game solution (Easter egg hunt)
>Add AI logic - fuzzy logic & routine patterns?
>Create objectives - player has to collect more 'eggs' than AI; AI will randomly search for 'eggs'
>Win condition; when all 'eggs' collected, AI stops and score screen. Round based?
