# AIMLProject
Project parts 1 and 2 for AI&amp;ML

TODO;
__Algorithms__
-COMMENT CODE!!!
-Implement both breadth-first and A* search algorithms for navigating open planned terrain
-Configure user-made maps for actors to traverse
-Include pattern prevention; actors stop when no possible path visible
-Track visited nodes on tilemap
-Implement queue order for rapid movement decision, complete decision process prior to movement
__GAMIFY__
-Transfer algorithms into game solution (Easter egg hunt)
-Add AI logic - fuzzy logic & routine patterns?
-Create objectives - player has to collect more 'eggs' than AI; AI will randomly search for 'eggs'
-Win condition; when all 'eggs' collected, AI stops and score screen. Round based?
